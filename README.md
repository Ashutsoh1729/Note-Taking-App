# Note-Taking-App

Here i have made a Note taking web application. Here i have applied my concepts of HTML, CSS and Js. Here i have used the localStorage to store all the notes created by the user and I have use some creazy Js concepts in order to manipulate the DOM.

I hope you get some inspiration form this project.

Thank You!
